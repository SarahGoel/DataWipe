#### **Step 3: Wipe Method Selection**
1. **Select a device** (use a USB drive for demo)
2. **Show method selection**
   - Point out recommended methods
   - Explain different standards
   - Show method descriptions

3. **Demo Script**
   > "Here we can see various wipe methods. For SSDs, we recommend cryptographic erasure as it's fastest and most secure. For HDDs, NIST 800-88 is the industry standard. Each method has detailed descriptions and time estimates."

#### **Step 4: Security Confirmation**
1. **Show warning dialogs**
2. **Highlight safety measures**
   - Multiple confirmation steps
   - Clear warnings about data destruction
   - Backup reminders

3. **Demo Script**
   > "Notice the multiple safety confirmations. ZeroTrace requires explicit confirmation that you understand data will be permanently destroyed. This prevents accidental data loss."

#### **Step 5: Progress Tracking** (Simulated)
1. **Start wipe process**
2. **Show real-time progress**
   - Progress bar with percentage
   - Status messages
   - Time estimates
   - Elapsed time

3. **Demo Script**

#### **Step 6: Certificate Generation**
1. **Show completion screen**
2. **Navigate to Certificates tab**
3. **Demonstrate certificate viewer**

4. **Demo Script**
   > "After completion, ZeroTrace generates tamper-proof certificates in both PDF and JSON formats. These certificates serve as legal proof of data destruction and include digital signatures for authenticity verification."

#### **Step 7: Certificate Features**
1. **Show certificate details**
   - Device information
   - Wipe operation details
   - Verification data
   - Digital signature information
   - Compliance standards

2. **Demonstrate verification**
   - Show certificate verification
   - Explain tamper-proof features

3. **Demo Script**
   > "The certificates include comprehensive details: device information, wipe method, verification hashes, and digital signatures. They meet NIST 800-88 and DoD 5220.22-M standards for compliance and audit purposes."

### **Phase 3: Technical Deep Dive (3-4 minutes)**

#### **Backend Architecture**
1. **Show API documentation** (http://localhost:8000/docs)
2. **Highlight key endpoints**
   - Device detection

   - Windows: PowerShell, WMI
   - macOS: system_profiler

### **Phase 4: Q&A Preparation**

#### **Common Questions & Answers**

**Q: How does this differ from standard disk formatting?**
A: Standard formatting only removes file system references. ZeroTrace performs multiple overwrite passes with verified patterns, making data recovery impossible even with forensic tools.

**Q: Is this suitable for enterprise use?**
A: Yes, ZeroTrace generates compliance certificates that meet NIST 800-88 and DoD 5220.22-M standards, making it suitable for enterprise data disposal and audit requirements.

**Q: How do you ensure the certificates are tamper-proof?**
A: Certificates are digitally signed using RSA-SHA256 with unique keys. Any modification invalidates the signature, providing cryptographic proof of authenticity.

**Q: What about SSDs and wear leveling?**
A: For SSDs, we use cryptographic erasure which destroys the encryption keys, making all data unrecoverable regardless of wear leveling. This is the preferred method for modern SSDs.

**Q: Can this be integrated into existing systems?**
A: Yes, ZeroTrace provides a RESTful API that can be integrated into existing IT asset management systems and workflows.
